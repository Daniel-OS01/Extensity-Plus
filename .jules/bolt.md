## 2024-05-24 - Deduplication Array Filter Objects

**Learning:** When using plain objects `{}` to deduplicate array values by keys (`seen[item]`), it not only incurs the overhead of callback functions inside `.filter()` but is also susceptible to prototype collision (e.g. `__proto__` or `constructor` strings) which can create bugs or silent data drops in deduplication logic.
**Action:** Always prefer ES6 `Set` with a standard `for` loop for `uniqueArray`-like operations to guarantee type distinction (1 vs '1'), prevent prototype issues, and gain significant iteration performance boosts.
## 2024-05-19 - [Knockout.js Array Performance in Loops]
**Learning:** Consolidating multiple array transformations (like `.map().filter()`) into a single `for` loop pass minimizes execution time by avoiding intermediate array allocations and allowing for early returns on direct matches (e.g., in `matchesExtension` search function).
**Action:** When working on performance-sensitive search or filtering logic, avoid chaining array methods. Use a single `for` loop, cache results conditionally, and use `return` early when possible.
## 2024-05-24 - Parallelized Chrome Alarm Clearing
**Learning:** Sequential `await` statements inside `for` loops used for Chrome API calls (like `chrome.alarms.clear`) represent a hidden I/O bottleneck in the background service worker, particularly when tearing down or rebuilding rule states.
**Action:** Always look for loops awaiting independent Chrome extension API calls and refactor them to use `Promise.all` with `Array.prototype.map()` for concurrent execution, which drastically cuts down total execution time.
## 2024-05-24 - Array Iteration over Transformation Chains

**Learning:** When generating configuration objects or extracting multiple state representations from a single base array (like `current.items` filtering and mapping in extension background scripts), utilizing chained native array methods (`.filter().map().filter().map()`) severely impacts performance by creating numerous intermediate arrays that necessitate additional memory allocation and multiple iteration cycles over the data.
**Action:** Always favor fusing multiple transformations and conditional filters into a single `for` loop pass over the base array. Accumulate the final target structures simultaneously within this single loop. This limits memory pressure by eliminating intermediate array allocations and bounds the execution to O(N) complexity instead of O(C * N) where C is the number of chained operations.
