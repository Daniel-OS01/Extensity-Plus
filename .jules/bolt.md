## 2024-05-24 - Deduplication Array Filter Objects

**Learning:** When using plain objects `{}` to deduplicate array values by keys (`seen[item]`), it not only incurs the overhead of callback functions inside `.filter()` but is also susceptible to prototype collision (e.g. `__proto__` or `constructor` strings) which can create bugs or silent data drops in deduplication logic.
**Action:** Always prefer ES6 `Set` with a standard `for` loop for `uniqueArray`-like operations to guarantee type distinction (1 vs '1'), prevent prototype issues, and gain significant iteration performance boosts.
## 2024-05-19 - [Knockout.js Array Performance in Loops]
**Learning:** Consolidating multiple array transformations (like `.map().filter()`) into a single `for` loop pass minimizes execution time by avoiding intermediate array allocations and allowing for early returns on direct matches (e.g., in `matchesExtension` search function).
**Action:** When working on performance-sensitive search or filtering logic, avoid chaining array methods. Use a single `for` loop, cache results conditionally, and use `return` early when possible.
## 2024-05-24 - Parallelized Chrome Alarm Clearing
**Learning:** Sequential `await` statements inside `for` loops used for Chrome API calls (like `chrome.alarms.clear`) represent a hidden I/O bottleneck in the background service worker, particularly when tearing down or rebuilding rule states.
**Action:** Always look for loops awaiting independent Chrome extension API calls and refactor them to use `Promise.all` with `Array.prototype.map()` for concurrent execution, which drastically cuts down total execution time.
## 2024-05-25 - Prevent Cache Poisoning in Pattern Compilation
**Learning:** When implementing string-keyed caches for compiled patterns (like `RegExp`), caching different types of patterns (e.g., wildcards vs. raw regexes) in the same dictionary can cause cache poisoning where a wildcard might match the raw regex string, altering core functionality. Also, complex regex literals in `replace_with_git_merge_diff` search blocks are prone to escaping errors.
**Action:** Always use separate cache dictionaries (e.g., `regexCache` and `wildcardCache`) when there are distinct logical paths for processing string keys. When writing patches involving complex regexes, target the simpler surrounding lines instead of the regex itself to avoid patch application errors.
